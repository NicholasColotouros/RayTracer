Assignments and Exercises in OpenGL using JOGL. This repository contains the eclipse workspace I used for each part.

## Assignment 1:

Created a humanoid-shaped Pikachu with joints that can be articulated around the arms, legs, hands, feet, neck, tail, ears and eyes. Mouth and pupil size can also be adjusted for a cartoony effect. A video demonstrating a simple wave animation can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8YiQC07TTE).
