# Ray Tracer
A Ray Tracer that was originall an assignment that I decided to add more features to and improve.

## Features:
The current rendering capabilities of the ray tracer include:
* Supported shapes:
 * Spheres
 * Boxes
 * Planes
 * Meshes (.obj files)
* Reflections
* Transparent surfaces
* Multithreading (from a thread pool)
* Bounding boxes around the meshes for performance
